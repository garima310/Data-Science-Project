Welcome to the 6-day Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Gene Insights dataset. 
This project is designed for daily uploads to GitHub, with one notebook dedicated to each day. The goal is to progressively analyze, clean, and visualize this dataset, wrapping up with feature insights and a cleaned CSV.
